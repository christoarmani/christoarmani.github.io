      <h1>About</h1>

      <div class="body-text">
      <p>I am a landscape and wildlife photographer located in Upstate, NY. I am passionate about the outdoors and creating great art. If I can make an image that profoundly impacts one person, that gives me great gratification and keeps me coming back more. My passion for photography has grown considerably over the years, and I can’t imagine my life without it. My journey started in 2008 when I was gifted an Olympus pocket camera for my 20th anniversary at my job. I would keep that camera on me pretty much all the time to capture moments with my friends and family. This was when the bug started within me. After that, I purchased a Canon camera above a pocket camera but not quite a DSLR.</p>

      <p>I replaced the pocket camera with this camera. Something still wasn’t right. I started seeing images on the internet and wanted to do the same as other photographers. Still, I found that the camera I had wouldn’t allow me to create images as I saw. I continued to research what photographers were doing to get these great images. The bug continued to grow. After extensive research, I settled on the Canon 5D Mark II. At this moment, I was now on my photography journey. Once I was able to take my first silky waterfall image, I was hooked. Creating images that would make people say, “wow, really made me feel good inside.” In a few years, I upgraded my current Canon 5D Mark II camera to the Canon 5D Mark III due to better technology and features. My images and understanding of light got better. At this point, I was hooked, and the bug was in full force. I would drag my nephews with me every chance I could to go chase waterfalls. I believe they would go with me because we would stop to eat at cool places and of course, you know who was buying.</p>

      <p>A couple years later, I was introduced to wildlife photography by my brother. Wow, was I in for a big surprise. I slapped on my 70-200mm lens and drove to a Wildlife Refuge. I didn’t realize how challenging and rewarding it would be to catch a bird in flight. However, after reviewing my images, I found that I needed to get closer to the subject somehow.    After some research, I purchased the Canon 7D Mark II and the Tamron 150-600mm G2 lens. Combined together, this rig would change my wildlife photography world. I was able to get closer to my subjects but still, be far away from them. I can spend hours studying and photographing wildlife and not disturb their natural habitat. To watch an animal’s behavior in its natural element is just an amazing thing. It really makes you appreciate nature and all that it has to offer. I still find wildlife photography challenging, especially birds in flight, but being challenged is good and makes for a fun journey.</p>
